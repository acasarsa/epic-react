## Epic React Study 

## Background
This is a container repo to hold my progress on the [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/) course by Kent C. Dodds. 
This course seems like a great intro or review for anyone looking to brush up on or learn React. I was most excited about the testing section and suspense. 

## System Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.19 or greater
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) `v14` or greater
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6.14 or greater

## Setup

This repo uses submodules so you'll need to run the following command to clone them all down:
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/acasarsa/epic-react.git
cd submodule_path // example: cd 01-react-hooks
node setup
```

Once there go to the README for that lesson and following the directions and you should be good to go. To see a blank copy of this course check the branch blank-course on each submodule.
